# A machine learning model augmented for image segmentation in computer vision, linked to a website and database.
- Includes a machine learning model based on some algorithm
- Will feed the ML model specific images for image segmentation
- The ML model will implement an image segmentation procedure
- Upload completed IS photos to a database - using an online photo database
- Database will be linked to a website via an API
- Potentially, able to view and download the photos from the website
