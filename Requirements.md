8. Shall be usable on Windows
9. Shall have PNG/JPG conversion to SVG when ML model produces images
10. Shall be synced with Git, commits often
11. Shall/Will be accessible on Android
12. Will have an algorithm running at less than O(n^2)
13. Will have image blurring
14. Will be able to watermark images optionally (potentially custom watermarks)
15. Will have website integration with image database
16. Will have before/after image comparison
17. Will be able to divide objects based on color or other properties
