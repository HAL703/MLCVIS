# Requirements
~~1. Shall develop a machine learning model~~ developed a machine learning model containing 3 different algorithms (technically 4)
~~2. Shall be able to implement effective image segmentation~~ effective is subjective, all 3 algorithms have their purposes
~~3. Shall be able to distinguish a single or multiple objects in given images~~ this is true now
4. Assuming the ML model produces new images, shall upload images to database
~~5. Shall discriminate pixel by pixel or by superpixels~~ MLM discriminates by pixel
~~6. Shall be able to strip non-essential objects (i.e. background)~~ this is true for some of the algorithms
7. Assuming there is time to create it, there shall be relatively simple interactibility/UI for website
~~8. Shall be usable on Windows~~ true, just need python currently
9. Shall have PNG/JPG conversion to SVG when ML model produces images
10. Shall be synced with Git, commits often
11. Shall/Will be accessible on Android
12. Will have an algorithm running at less than O(n^2)
13. Will have image blurring
14. Will be able to watermark images optionally (potentially custom watermarks)
15. Will have website integration with image database
16. Will have before/after image comparison
~~17. Will be able to divide objects based on color or other properties~~ there is a color detection algorithm
~~18. Will have more than one algorithm for image segmentation~~ 3 main algorithms with 1 extra necessary for bit masking
19. Will be usable on IOS, Linux, OSX
